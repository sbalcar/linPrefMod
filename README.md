# LinPrefMod
This program simulates and visualises users' preferences in linear monotonic preference models. Visualizer shows data cube, preference function cubes and preference cube. The tool allows the user to visualise predefined preference functions, aggregation functions and data points with their preferences.

The main use of this program is for testing statistic and ML methods for learning users' preferences models. Methods can be compared not only based on predefined metrics (RMSE, Precision, Recall) but also with help of graphical contourlines of preferences.
